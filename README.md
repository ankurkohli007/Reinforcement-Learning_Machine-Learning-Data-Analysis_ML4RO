There are several approaches to solving the Mountain Car problem using Reinforcement Learning. One popular approach is to use a variant of Q-learning known as Deep Q-Network (DQN).

DQN involves training a neural network to estimate the optimal action-value function, which represents the expected future rewards for taking a particular action in a particular state. The network takes in the current state of the car as input and outputs the expected rewards for each possible action.

During training, the network is updated using a variant of the Bellman equation, which relates the value of a state to the value of its successor states. The goal of training is to find the parameters of the network that minimize the difference between the predicted action values and the true action values.

To deal with the continuous action space, DQN can be combined with an approach known as actor-critic. In this approach, a separate neural network is trained to estimate the policy, which specifies the probability of taking each possible action given the current state. The policy network is updated using the gradient of the expected rewards with respect to the policy parameters.

In summary, the solution to the Mountain Car problem using Reinforcement Learning involves training a neural network to estimate the optimal action-value function and the policy function, using a combination of DQN and actor-critic approaches. The resulting policy should allow the car to navigate the winding road and build up enough momentum to reach the top of the hill within the specified time limit or reach a high enough position on the hill.
